    <meta property="og:description" content="The season of Advent is a special season. We begin to see indications that Christmas is coming. From the greenery and lights going up around our city to the red coffee cups at Starbucks, we are reminded on a daily basis that Christmas is not far away.
As Advent Christians, we have an opportunity to look deeper into the anticipation of the season. We understand the expectancy of the Messiah throughout Israel&rsquo;s history. Hundreds of years before Jesus&rsquo; birth, the prophets proclaimed his coming.
This week, we come to another passage from Isaiah. Like like week&rsquo;s sermon, we will reflect on a familiar and powerful passage. Let me encourage you to read it as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

(Isaiah 40:1-11 NIV) Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins. A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” A voice says, “Cry out.” And I said, “What shall I cry?” “All people are like grass, and all their faithfulness is like the flowers of the field. The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the Lord blows on them. Surely the people are grass. The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever.” You who bring good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God!” See, the Sovereign Lord comes with power, and he rules with a mighty arm. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him. He tends his flock like a shepherd: He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
