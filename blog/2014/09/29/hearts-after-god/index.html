    <meta property="og:description" content="On Sunday, we will finish up our series on the life of David. I have enjoyed walking through David&rsquo;s life with you. It has been satisfying to revisit familiar stories and be surprised by unfamiliar ones. The obscure stories have been the most fun. I hope that you will take the time to watch/listen to any of the weeks that you missed. The entire series is published on the Web site as a podcast or on the YouTube Channel in video format.
As we come to the final week, we will explore David&rsquo;s final words to his people and his son Solomon. David is old; his time on earth is coming to an end. He gathers his people together to pass the torch to Solomon. As we explore his words, we learn much about David&rsquo;s values. This week, we will use the 1 Chronicles account of David&rsquo;s life (1 Chronicles 28-29). David challenges his son,

(1 Chronicles 28:8 NIV) So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the LORD your God.

David knows first hand what it means to veer from God&rsquo;s command. It is not fun. He pleads with his son to stick with God. Look at how he describes following God.

(1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV) And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts.

It is not enough to simply follow the rules. David knows that God is less interested in our actions, more interested in our hearts. Chris Tomlin communicates this facet of David&rsquo;s life in his song, Your Heart. see YouTube video. The chorus relates,

At the end of the day, I wanna hear people say, My heart looks like your heart, My heart looks like your heart. When the world looks at me, let them agree, My heart looks like your heart, My heart looks like your heart.

David wants his son&rsquo;s heart to follow God heart. The challenge for us, as we read these words, is to align our heart with God&rsquo;s heart. David&rsquo;s story is a grand story. It has plenty of adventure, wrong turns, drama and redemption. But at the end of the day, we find a man longing to align his heart with God&rsquo;s heart.
I hope you will join us on Sunday as we conclude our study on the life of David.

 <p>On Sunday, we will finish up our series on the life of David. I have enjoyed walking through David&rsquo;s life with you. It has been satisfying to revisit familiar stories and be surprised by unfamiliar ones. The obscure stories have been the most fun. I hope that you will take the time to watch/listen to any of the weeks that you missed. The entire series is published on the Web site as a <a href="http://fbcmuncie.org/podcast/">podcast</a> or on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBRVpkR08uqzgSOI-IQy7ooEtVdJ4elis">YouTube Channel</a> in video format.</p>
<p>As we come to the final week, we will explore David&rsquo;s final words to his people and his son Solomon. David is old; his time on earth is coming to an end. He gathers his people together to pass the torch to Solomon. As we explore his words, we learn much about David&rsquo;s values. This week, we will use the 1 Chronicles account of David&rsquo;s life (1 Chronicles 28-29). David challenges his son,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1 Chronicles 28:8 NIV) So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God: Be careful to follow all the commands of the LORD your God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David knows first hand what it means to veer from God&rsquo;s command. It is not fun. He pleads with his son to stick with God. Look at how he describes following God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1 Chronicles 28:9 NIV) And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not enough to simply follow the rules. David knows that God is less interested in our actions, more interested in our hearts. Chris Tomlin communicates this facet of David&rsquo;s life in his song, <em>Your Heart</em>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aWEhNqnjuY">see YouTube video</a>. The chorus relates,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, I wanna hear people say, My heart looks like your heart, My heart looks like your heart. When the world looks at me, let them agree, My heart looks like your heart, My heart looks like your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David wants his son&rsquo;s heart to follow God heart. The challenge for us, as we read these words, is to align our heart with God&rsquo;s heart. David&rsquo;s story is a grand story. It has plenty of adventure, wrong turns, drama and redemption. But at the end of the day, we find a man longing to align his heart with God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>I hope you will join us on Sunday as we conclude our study on the life of David.</p>
