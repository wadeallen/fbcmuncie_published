    <meta property="og:description" content="The CCT met last night to discuss worship services, building usage, and planned activities in light of the CDC recommendations for social distancing. The CCT will continue to meet weekly during this season to provide direction and support for the congregation at First Baptist. We are meeting over a video conferencing platform.
We will send detailed notes once the CCT has been able to review them, along with budget reports. For now, let me summarize plans through the end of the month.
Following the church constitution, Wade and Brian Green (chairman of the diaconate) made the decision to cancel worship services on March 22 and March 28. We will possibly cancel more services, but will make that decision within the next two weeks.
All building usage by groups will be discontinued through the end of the month. This includes weddings, funerals, music rehearsals, outreach programs, team meetings. If a funeral is necessary, the church is suggesting that a small graveside service be held now and a memorial service be scheduled for a later date.
The church office will be open daily from 9AM to noon. It will be closed in the afternoons. A sign will be placed on the door to direct those seeking assistance. Several community organizations are providing meals and support. We will list these opportunities on the sign.
We are planning to contact all active church families during this season. If you would be willing to make phone calls, please fill out this form.
http://bit.ly/fbc-phone
We will be having a brief video training session to discuss this ministry. If you are not comfortable using video, you will be able to call into the meeting via phone. You can choose one of two options:
Sunday, March 22 at 2 PM or Monday, March 23 at 7 PM
Youth and children ministries are planning on conducting virtual lessons. Adult Sunday school classes and life groups are encouraged to stay connected through phone calls or video meetings.
Dan has activated online giving and more information will be forthcoming about how this works.
Please know these changes and cancellations have been implemented not just for your own safety, but for the health and welfare of the entire community. The CCT is working very hard to stay informed about this situation and will continue to provide you with any changes or new info as it becomes available.
Over the next several weeks, we will continue to meet (virtually) and discuss new ways to stay connected as a church family. Let’s continue to pray for family, friends, neighbors and all those around the world affected by this pandemic. Let’s continue to be the Church here in Muncie and surrounding communities. Let’s continue to keep our eyes on the Lord. “God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble.” Psalm 46:1
