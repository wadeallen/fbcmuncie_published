    <meta property="og:description" content="I would like to thank Caleb Rolling for preaching this past weekend. Caleb is a student at Taylor University and is studying to become a pastor. Thank you Caleb for bringing God&rsquo;s Word to us on Sunday.
As we continue through the gospel of Matthew this week, we come to a story where Jesus catches fishermen off guard (no pun intended). He interrupts their work and invites them to follow him. I would encourage you to read this week&rsquo;s text as you prepare for worship on Sunday.

(Matthew 4:12-23 NIV) When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee. Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali&ndash; to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah: &ldquo;Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles&ndash; the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.&rdquo; From that time on Jesus began to preach, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.&rdquo; As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. &ldquo;Come, follow me,&rdquo; Jesus said, &ldquo;and I will make you fishers of men.&rdquo; At once they left their nets and followed him. Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them, and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
