    <meta property="og:description" content="It was fun to talk about Peter in worship this past Sunday. Several of you have identified with Peter&rsquo;s tendency to speak first and think later. We all know someone like Peter. While his passion and zeal are admirable, we can see the peril of such behavior. At the same time, God formed Peter into the person who was able to direct his fervor into humble submission to God&rsquo;s ways.
This week we turn to Peter&rsquo;s lesser known brother, Andrew. While Andrew&rsquo;s personality was quite different from his brother, God used him nonetheless. Understanding the dynamics of sibling relationships, we might think it difficult to have been Peter&rsquo;s brother. Peter&rsquo;s strong personality often captured everyone&rsquo;s attention. Andrew could have easily resented his brother&rsquo;s charisma. Yet, this does not seem to be the case. If we go back to John 1, Andrew is actually the one who introduced Peter to Jesus. When he and John find Jesus, he is excited to share their finding with his brother.

(John 1:40-42 NIV) Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.

This is a common pattern in Andrew&rsquo;s life. While Andrew is portrayed as a behind-the-scenes kind of guy, he is active in connecting people with Jesus. When Jesus feeds the five thousand, Andrew is the one to bring the boy to Jesus.

(John 6:8-9 NIV) Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?”

Andrew is only mentioned 9 times in the New Testament, a minuscule amount compared to his brother. Andrew is not the front page disciple; his name does not appear in the headlines. Yet he plays a crucial role among the disciples. When the other disciples are fighting for position, Andrew does not seem to participate. In comparison to his brother and the Sons of Thunder (James and John), Andrew seems unassuming and eager to serve.
Join us on Sunday as we discuss Andrew. We are reminded that God needs behind-the-scenes workers who are not concerned with prestige and reputation.

 <p>It was fun to talk about Peter in worship this past Sunday. Several of you have identified with Peter&rsquo;s tendency to speak first and think later. We all know someone like Peter. While his passion and zeal are admirable, we can see the peril of such behavior. At the same time, God formed Peter into the person who was able to direct his fervor into humble submission to God&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>This week we turn to Peter&rsquo;s lesser known brother, Andrew. While Andrew&rsquo;s personality was quite different from his brother, God used him nonetheless. Understanding the dynamics of sibling relationships, we might think it difficult to have been Peter&rsquo;s brother. Peter&rsquo;s strong personality often captured everyone&rsquo;s attention.

<blockquote>
<p>(John 6:8-9 NIV) Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, “Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?”</p>

<p>Andrew is only mentioned 9 times in the New Testament, a minuscule amount compared to his brother. Andrew is not the front page disciple; his name does not appear in the headlines. Yet he plays a crucial role among the disciples. When the other disciples are fighting for position, Andrew does not seem to participate. In comparison to his brother and the <em>Sons of Thunder</em> (James and John), Andrew seems unassuming and eager to serve.</p>
