    <meta property="og:description" content="I am enjoying working through the first epistle of John. Sometimes however, his words are difficult to read. It requires looking back over his life and particularly at his gospel to fully understand his intentions. This week, we come to our final sermon in this brief series. As we explore 1 John 5:9-13, John talks about the testimony of God.
When we think of testimony, our minds often gravitate toward a courtroom. We picture someone telling their story and explaining what they saw or heard or experienced. Certainly, John has a testimony. In his lifetime, he experienced Jesus in incredible ways; he walked with him, saw him die, witnessed his resurrection. John has a story to tell. But John is more concerned about God&rsquo;s testimony, God&rsquo;s story.
John writes,

(1 John 5:9 NIV11-GK) We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.

On Sunday, we will explore God&rsquo;s story. John understands God&rsquo;s testimony as providing life (zoe). He describes,

(1 John 5:11–12 NIV11-GK)  And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.

This is why the elder John is writing this letter. He wants his readers to take part in what he has experienced. He knows that God&rsquo;s plan is to include future generations in His story. While he has encountered monumental moments of history, he knows that the life and love of Jesus extends to his readers. He explains,

(1 John 5:13 NIV11-GK) I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.

Join us on Sunday as we study 1 John 5:9-13 together. As we pull in passages from John&rsquo;s gospel, we will encounter the full meaning of John&rsquo;s words in this text.
