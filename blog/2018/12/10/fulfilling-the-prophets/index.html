Video from Last Week
This week, we spend one more week in the Old Testament before transitioning to the New Testament. We have spent several weeks looking at the words of the prophets, really the words of God to his people hundreds of years before Jesus. These words give us insight into Jesus&rsquo; life and mission. In fact, these are the words that Jesus used to explain his mission to his followers. We come this week to Isaiah 42:1-9. Jesus quoted this passage as he interpreted his role in God&rsquo;s story. This week, we will see how Jesus fulfilled all that Isaiah was describing in this passage. Let me encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for worship. See you on Sunday.

(Isaiah 42:1-9 NIV) “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;     he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.” This is what God the Lord says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. “I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols. See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.”

<p><a href="http://fbcmuncie.org/video/2018/12/09/esther">Video from Last Week</a></p>
<p>This week, we spend one more week in the Old Testament before transitioning to the New Testament. We have spent several weeks looking at the words of the prophets, really the words of God to his people hundreds of years before Jesus. These words give us insight into Jesus&rsquo; life and mission. In fact, these are the words that Jesus used to explain his mission to his followers. We come this week to Isaiah 42:1-9. Jesus quoted this passage as he interpreted his role in God&rsquo;s story. This week, we will see how Jesus fulfilled all that Isaiah was describing in this passage. Let me encourage you to read ahead as you prepare for worship. See you on Sunday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Isaiah 42:1-9 NIV) “Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the nations. He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;     he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his teaching the islands will put their hope.” This is what God the Lord says— the Creator of the heavens, who stretches them out, who spreads out the earth with all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it: “I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness. “I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols. See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you.”</p>
