<description>In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.

<description>John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God&amp;rsquo;s calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for this valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John&amp;rsquo;s initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John&amp;rsquo;s tendency continues to be our own experience.

Then the scene turns to the great white throne where everyone faces judgment. These scenes prepare us for the new creation in which God will restore all that was lost in Eden.

John invites us to Hallelujah (praise Yahweh) in this chapter. Why? Because evil will be destroyed and the Messiah is going to come to establish His long awaited Kingdom.

<description>In Revelation 18, a mighty angel declares the fall of Babylon. The poetry in this chapter paints of picture of the fall of evil. As Babylon is an image for all evil empires, we know that John&amp;rsquo;s first readers must have applied this to Rome. As we consider these descriptions, we are able to discern the characteristics of the beast&amp;rsquo;s empire in contrast to the Lamb&amp;rsquo;s kingdom.

<description>John is carried way by one of the seven angels. He encounters a prostitute sitting on a monster or beast. Loaded with Old Testament allusions, we experience the ruin of the false substitute for God&amp;rsquo;s plan for restoration. As we explore the symbols of this chapter, Rome is exposed for its true self. We are challenged in our world by the imitations of God&amp;rsquo;s gifts to us.

<description>Revelation 15 is an interlude in the drama. John witnesses another sign that points to the end. He envisions a glass sea filled with faithful worshipers along with seven angels holding bowls of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath. This pause allows us to reflect on the object of our worship. May we worship the one true God and deny giving our time, attention and resources to anything else.

<title>Two Monsters</title>

<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2019-10-13.mp3</guid>
<description>In Revelation 13, two monsters appear. They are powerful forces in the world and demand allegiance, worship. They are empowered by the dragon and are given authority over the world. The followers of the Lamb stand in contrast to the dragon and his beasts. As we consider ancient books like Daniel, we understand this imagery as spanning all times and places. While the names change, the monsters described appear throughout history. The real question is how the followers of the Lamb will resist.

<description>Revelation 12 describes heavenly realities with new images. As we continue our journey deeper into Revelation, we find two new signs. A woman and a dragon come onto the scene. We will discover how this imagery tells the story of God’s working in our world and the evil one’s disdain for the people of God.

<title>Two Witnesses</title>

<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2019-09-29.mp3</guid>
<description>In Revelation 11, we encounter a strange story of two witnesses who are killed, bodies exposed and then raised to life. We wonder how this account fits into the rest of Revelation. As we begin to understand how the witnesses represent the church, we see how God&amp;rsquo;s redemptive plan involves his people. And when the plagues fail to bring repentance in the world, the lives of the witnesses lead to a turning around of the world.

As we consider the imagery of this chapter, we feel the tension of the final days. God&amp;rsquo;s great restoration is fantastic, but the closing of opportunity for repentance is dire.

Repentance is rejected following intense death and destruction. Yet God&amp;rsquo;s salvation story is not over. He is moving toward a saving end.

While it is difficult to narrow this down, we find that God&amp;rsquo;s heart is constantly on the side of the poor. It is our job to join Him as he reaches out to those in need.

<itunes:subtitle>As we prepare for our July neighborhood canvas, we pause to consider God&amp;rsquo;s heart for the poor. We will survey the Scriptures for passages relating to the poor. While it is difficult to narrow this down, we find that God&amp;rsquo;s heart is constantly on the side of the poor. It is our job to join Him as he reaches out to those in need.

<description>On Ascension Sunday, we find the disciples witnessing lifted into heaven. In time, Jesus&amp;rsquo; followers will be empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out God&amp;rsquo;s mission in this world. We might imagine their response as one of fear and uncertainty.

<description>Luke 24 records three encounters. Last week, we studied the women at the tomb. However, Easter does not end with this story. Today, we pick up with two disciples on a journey to Emmauus. They are confused, discouraged when they encounter the risen Christ. They do not recognize Jesus until thier journey is over. As we join them on this journey, we are able to see how Jesus empowers thier faith. In the same way, our doubts and confusion can be changed into intense faith as we encounter the story of God.

There they experience an impressive display of God&amp;rsquo;s power, along with an affirmation of Jesus&amp;rsquo; identity. The Transfiguration reminds us of God&amp;rsquo;s mission through the work of Jesus on the Cross.

<description>As we survey the feeding of the five thousand, we are reminded of how Jesus calls us to join Him. We, like the disciples, do not have what it takes to fulfill God&amp;rsquo;s mission in our world. Yet Jesus will empower our small offerings to complete his work in our world.

<title>The Parables of Jesus</title>
<link>https://2020.fbcmuncie.org/video/2019/02/17/the-parables-of-jesus/</link>
<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2019-02-17.mp3</guid>
<description>Jesus often teaches his followers through parables. In Matthew 13:24-43, Jesus describes the Kingdom of God as weeds growing beside wheat, a mustard seed becoming a large tree and yeast working its way through dough. As we reflect on these parables, we are reminded that the sometimes slow moving Kingdom is a powerful force that will one day make the world right. At the same time, we are challenged to dig deeper by asking questions and seeking God&amp;rsquo;s way and will as we follow Him.

He tells them to be ready. God is on the move once again and is bringing his kingdom to earth. Jesus appears in the wilderness and is baptized by John. The Spirit anoints him and the Father&amp;rsquo;s voice affirms his identity. Are we ready to repent and join God in all that he is doing?

January 6 is the celebration of Epiphany. This celebration marks the events of Matthew 2, the coming of the three kings (wise men). We will explore the story of the wise men, separating myth from reality. The Magi offer insight into Jesus&amp;rsquo; life and purpose.

<description>King Solomon quickly discovers the complexity of leading the people of God. In 1 Kings 3:4-15, Solomon encounters God in a dream or night vision.

<description>The story of David and Bathsheba would qualify for a TV mini-series or blockbuster movie. We have all the elements; adultery, sex, misuse of power, lying, and murder litter the story. But the Bible records more than just the historical account. We have insight into David&amp;rsquo;s heart during this period. Psalm 51 records his response to God after being confronted by Nathan. As we explore this text, we find characteristics of true repentance and true restoration.

<description>As we begin a four week series in 1 John, we explore the opening words of this epistle. John relates his experience with the eternal Word of Life. He proclaims his first hand experience (seeing, touching, hearing) to refute false theories of a non-physical Jesus. In turn, we can join with John in the life that only Jesus can give.

We discover that God&amp;rsquo;s mission includes leaving us in the midst of a dangerous world in order to expose God&amp;rsquo;s love. We are challenged by this prayer toward unity and holiness as we live out God&amp;rsquo;s calling.

<title>Seeing and Following Jesus</title>

<description>As we come to Mark 10, we are exposed to the obstacles that keep people from following Jesus. The religious leaders are more concerned with trapping Jesus than hearing him. The disciples miss the point of the Kingdom on more than one occasion. Yet toward the end of this chapter, we are given an image of a once-blind man following Jesus into Jerusalem. Jesus is determined to give his all for the sins of the world. Will we follow him?

<title>The Jesus Way</title>
<link>https://2020.fbcmuncie.org/video/2018/02/18/the-jesus-way/</link>
<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2018-02-18.mp3</guid>
<description>As we continue the story of Jesus, we find it easy to confess Him as Messiah. Yet when it comes down to it, following Jesus is not easy. The path of Jesus involves suffering, sacrifice, giving up. As we journey with Jesus and his disciples through the story, we find that we are often like the disciples. We lack the faith do be all that God calls us to be. Yet as we depend on Jesus&amp;rsquo; power, we can find all that is necessary to be authentic followers of Jesus.

<description>As Mark continues to relate the story of Jesus, we are beginning to see patterns. Jesus&amp;rsquo; constant conflict with the religious leaders, the miracles that reveal Jesus&amp;rsquo; power over creation and his disciples lack of understanding all characterize his ministry. The final miracle in this week&amp;rsquo;s text is an image of the disciples realization of Jesus&amp;rsquo; true identity and mission.

<description>As we explore the message of Jesus, as recorded by Mark, we find him speaking to the crowds in parables. Many do not understand and believe. But for those who are seeking God, his word will grow and produce a great harvest. We are challenged to open our ears and hearts to Jesus&amp;rsquo; words so that his Kingdom can take root in our lives.

<description>Mark describes several encounters that Jesus has with the religious leaders. As we review five narratives in Mark 2:1-3:12, we see a common pattern. Jesus or his disciples act. They are questioned by the religious leaders. Jesus speaks to his calling, his mission, his identity. As we move along in Mark&amp;rsquo;s account, we encounter Jesus&amp;rsquo; bold claims that will lead to his death.
