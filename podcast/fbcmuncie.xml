<description>As we come once again to the passage we call The Beatitudes, we consider how counter cultural and counter religious Jesus&amp;rsquo; description of his followers might seem. Yet as we explore why Jesus must have opened his sermon with this description, we begin to rethink spiritual success.
Music Videos We have several videos for you this week. We would suggest you listen in this order if you prefer traditional service style:
  If you prefer contemporary, you can watch the video below before or after the sermon:
  This is a suggested closing video:

<description>As we prepare for our study on the Sermon on the Mount, we explore how to read this ever important section of Matthew&amp;rsquo;s gospel. Too often, we attempt to redefine Jesus&amp;rsquo; words in light of the ethical systems of our day. Instead, we need to understand Jesus as the authoritative Messiah who is forming a people to fulfill the mission of God in the world.

<description>As we venture with Jesus into the Garden of Gethsemane, we explore Jesus&amp;rsquo; courageous prayer in contract to the failings of the disciples. We consider how God might be calling us to surrender to his will rather than following our own.

<description>The story of the rich young man in Matthew 19 challenges our understanding of wealth. But more importantly, it confronts the notion that we can earn eternal life by doing some good deed. Only as we give up and follow Jesus can we discover what it means to enter the Kingdom of God.

<title>Surrender Our Fear</title>

<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2020-03-15.mp3</guid>
<description>In this video podcast, our pastor addresses the congregation at First Baptist Church in Muncie in the wake of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. As we explore the Bible&amp;rsquo;s teaching around fear, anxiety, and peace, we remember God&amp;rsquo;s instruction to trust and rely on Him alone. We often see how fear and faith live in contrast to one another. May God provide all that we need and guide us in this season of uncertainty.

<link>https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/03/01/surrender-forgiveness/</link>
<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2020-03-01.mp3</guid>
<description>Peter asks Jesus an honest question. He wants to know how far forgiveness can go. How many times do we forgive? Jesus answers his question with a story, a parable. In Matthew 18:21-35, we are challenged with the parable of the unforgiving servant. As we read the story, we relate to the astonishing inconsistency. For those of us who have received forgiveness, we discover the necessity to do the same for others.

<description>The season of Epiphany ends with the story of the Transfiguration. In this story Jesus turns toward the Cross. On this dynamic occasion, Jesus takes Peter, James and John with him to the top of mountain. There they experience an impressive display of God&amp;rsquo;s power, along with an affirmation of Jesus&amp;rsquo; identity. The Transfiguration reminds us of God&amp;rsquo;s mission through the work of Jesus on the Cross.

<description>In the season of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, we think a lot about hearts. In Matthew 5:21-37, Jesus is not talking about romantic love. He calls us to examine our hearts in terms of sin. As we continue our study on Jesus&amp;rsquo; words, we are challenged to allow God to do the inner work of transforming our hearts. Adjusting our actions is impossible without a change of heart.

<description>In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.

<itunes:subtitle>In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.

<description>John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God&amp;rsquo;s calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for this valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John&amp;rsquo;s initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John&amp;rsquo;s tendency continues to be our own experience.

<description>On this first Sunday of Epiphany, we consider the journey of the wise men. They travel a great distance and offer valuable gifts in order to worship Jesus. Their worship is a model of authentic worship. May we consider our own acts of worship as we engage the story together.
