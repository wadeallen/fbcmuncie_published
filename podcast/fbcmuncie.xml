<title>The Heart</title>
<link>https://2020.fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/02/16/the-heart/</link>

<description>In the season of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, we think a lot about hearts. In Matthew 5:21-37, Jesus is not talking about romantic love. He calls us to examine our hearts in terms of sin. As we continue our study on Jesus&amp;rsquo; words, we are challenged to allow God to do the inner work of transforming our hearts. Adjusting our actions is impossible without a change of heart.

<description>In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.

<description>John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God&amp;rsquo;s calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for this valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John&amp;rsquo;s initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John&amp;rsquo;s tendency continues to be our own experience.

<description>On this first Sunday of Epiphany, we consider the journey of the wise men. They travel a great distance and offer valuable gifts in order to worship Jesus. Their worship is a model of authentic worship. May we consider our own acts of worship as we engage the story together.
