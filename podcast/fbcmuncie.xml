<description>As Paul closes his letter to the church at Philippi. He reflects on the provisions received from Epaphroditus. He is careful to express his gratitude to God without encouraging a patron relationship that was so common in the first century. We can learn much from Paul&amp;rsquo;s understanding of financial support for spiritual leaders.

<description>Paul&amp;rsquo;s imprisonment is a difficult life circumstance; he is not sure if he will make it out alive. All the while, the church at Philippi is struggling with persecution and false teachers. It is into this context that Paul instructs the church to avoid anxiety by presenting their petitions to God. He assures them that God&amp;rsquo;s peace will overwhelm them and continue to protect them.

<description>As we flip over to chapter 4 in our Philippians study, Paul addresses the church with deep affection. He then calls out two women who seem to be in conflict with one another. Paul realizes how quickly a church family can be divided and destroyed. We can learn much from these words as we consider how we function at First Baptist Church Muncie.

<description>Paul has learned to reframe his perspective. He looks past his current circumstances and looks forward to God&amp;rsquo;s ultimate plan to rescue and redeem His people.

<description>Paul calls out the methods of false teachers, highlights his resume in light of their tactics, but quickly crumbles it up and throws it away. He then calls the church at Philippi to take a different approach, one of knowing Jesus. Knowing Jesus involves giving up, laying down, joining Him in his sufferings. But in doing this, we will also be able to participate in His resurrection.

<description>The final verses in Philippians 2 (19-30) could be seen as minor instructions pertaining to Paul&amp;rsquo;s companions. They give an indication of how Paul plans to send these fellow servants back to Philippi. But as we dig a bit deeper, we discover powerful descriptions that point us toward faithful service to Christ. These verses help us examine how we might serve God in the same sort of way.

<description>Paul&amp;rsquo;s desire to please God far outweighs his desire for his own comfort, status, or reputation. He challenges the church at Philippi to have the same sort of mindset. In Philippians 2:12-18, Paul urges them to work out how to please God in the midst of difficult situations. In the same way, we must consider this dynamic in our lives. Who are we trying to please?

<description>Paul turns from a discussion about his imprisonment to instruction to the church at Philippi. He prompts them to reflect on the ways in which they have benefited from Christ and encourages them to model the posture of Christ. He bids them to relinquish selfish ambition and vanity in order to take on humility and an others first mindset. In doing this, the church will complete Paul&amp;rsquo;s joy.

<description>As Paul writes to the church at Philippi, he is imprisoned with an uncertain fate. Yet in this letter, he expresses joy and trust that God will provide deliverance. But in Paul&amp;rsquo;s mind, deliverance does not necessarily mean an improvement in circumstances. It might be death. Paul relentless trust in God in every circumstance prompts us to consider our response to the challenges of 2020.

Paul is filled with joy in the midst of a chaotic world. He is sure that God is working and moving in the difficult situations at hand. As we consider the troublesome days of 2020, these words have incredible application to us.

<description>Jesus&amp;rsquo; instructions to non-retaliation are perhaps the most difficult words in the Sermon on the Mount. Our concern for justice often serves as an excuse to give people what they deserve. Yet Jesus proposes a radical, generous, forgiving posture toward those who mistreat us.

We should not escalate our words in order to heighten our level of honesty. We should live lives of simple honesty in all we say and do.

<description>Marriage and divorce are important and complicated issues throughout the Bible. Jesus exposes the permissiveness of the first century religious leaders in regards to divorce. He raises the standard for marriage and reconciliation. As we discuss the issue of divorce, we survey other parts of the New Testament for a more complete understanding of this complex issue.

<description>This has not been an easy year. With the COVID-19 Pandemic, the economic implications of the pandemic, along with the recent events surrounding the tragic death of George Floyd, our world seems out of control. At the same time, voices from all directions are speaking. How do we know who is telling the truth and who is twisting the narrative for their own purposes. How do we respond to all that we are seeing and hearing as followers of Jesus? James gives us insight into these issues.

<description>Jesus calls his followers to radical adherence to the Law. More than just remaining in the bounds of rules, Jesus prompts us to stop sin at the source. In Matthew 5:27-30, Jesus directs us away from lust and calls us to submit our eyes and hands to him as we seek to love one another.

<description>In Matthew 5:17-20, Jesus warns against throwing out the Old Testament in light of his life and ministry. Rather, Jesus explains his fulfillment of the Old Testament. As we read all of God&amp;rsquo;s story, from Genesis to Revelation, through the lens of Jesus, we discover how Jesus completes what God plan to restore his creation.

<description>On Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day, we take a break from the Sermon on the Mount series to travel a bit further back in time. We reflect on the story of Samuel&amp;rsquo;s mother, Hannah. As a barren woman she was grief stricken. God comes to her in her brokenness and provides a child. Through this story, we learn much about what it means to be a mother. At the same time, we also learn what it means to bring our heartache to God.

<description>The familiar passage about salt and light is often simplified into Jesus&amp;rsquo; followers serving as moral influencers in our broken world. Yet the story of God provides a greater calling for us. We are created by God in His image and called to be a kingdom of priests in our world. As we explore several passages throughout God&amp;rsquo;s story, we can read Matthew 5:13-16 as call to live out this grand purpose in the places where God has placed us.
Music Videos We have several videos for you this week. We would suggest you listen in this order if you prefer traditional service style:
  Also, you can use this video as a meditation as you take communion:

<description>The story of the rich young man in Matthew 19 challenges our understanding of wealth. But more importantly, it confronts the notion that we can earn eternal life by doing some good deed. Only as we give up and follow Jesus can we discover what it means to enter the Kingdom of God.

<title>Surrender Our Fear</title>
<link>https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/03/15/surrender-our-fear/</link>
<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2020-03-15.mp3</guid>
<description>In this video podcast, our pastor addresses the congregation at First Baptist Church in Muncie in the wake of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic. As we explore the Bible&amp;rsquo;s teaching around fear, anxiety, and peace, we remember God&amp;rsquo;s instruction to trust and rely on Him alone. We often see how fear and faith live in contrast to one another. May God provide all that we need and guide us in this season of uncertainty.

<title>Surrender: Forgiveness</title>
<link>https://fbcmuncie.org/video/2020/03/01/surrender-forgiveness/</link>
<guid>http://audio.fbcmuncie.org/2020-03-01.mp3</guid>
<description>Peter asks Jesus an honest question. He wants to know how far forgiveness can go. How many times do we forgive? Jesus answers his question with a story, a parable. In Matthew 18:21-35, we are challenged with the parable of the unforgiving servant. As we read the story, we relate to the astonishing inconsistency. For those of us who have received forgiveness, we discover the necessity to do the same for others.

<description>In the season of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day, we think a lot about hearts. In Matthew 5:21-37, Jesus is not talking about romantic love. He calls us to examine our hearts in terms of sin. As we continue our study on Jesus&amp;rsquo; words, we are challenged to allow God to do the inner work of transforming our hearts. Adjusting our actions is impossible without a change of heart.

<description>In Matthew 4:12-23 Jesus leaves his hometown to begin his ministry. His actions are decisive; there is no turning back. He invites others to join Him on His mission. They too are quick to respond. They drop everything (right in the middle of their work) to join him. As we study this text together, we are reminded of what it looks like to follow Jesus.

<description>John the Baptist was deemed the greatest man every born by Jesus. He was faithful to God&amp;rsquo;s calling to live in the desert, eat locusts and honey, preach a bold and offensive message. In fact, he would be killed for this valiant message. Yet when Jesus approaches him for baptism, John&amp;rsquo;s initial response was to forbid Jesus. We will explore how John&amp;rsquo;s tendency continues to be our own experience.
